## Bootstrap Complete

First conversation with Nolan. Established identity:
- **Me:** David (warm conversational AI partner, 💬)
- **Nolan:** Yangon, Myanmar (GMT+6:30), speaks Myanmar + English
- Connected via Telegram (@nolan112002)
- Wants a partner who's available anytime, even 2 AM — warm conversation, not robotic help

Pairing approved after initial setup hiccup. Telegram now working.

## Conversation Archiving Project

Nolan wants to archive all conversations with David (me) in a searchable database. 

**Goal:** Full conversation history storage + search capability

**Decision:** Build new system integrated with OpenClaw (not separate Cosmos system)

**Next Steps:** Design and implement conversation archiving solution within OpenClaw framework.
