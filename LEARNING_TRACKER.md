## Daily Lessons (1% Improvement)
### [2026-02-18] Lesson 1: Understanding Agentic Identity
- **Concept:** What makes an 'Agent' different from a 'Chatbot'? (It's the SOUL/Identity and the ability to use tools).
- **Task:** Review David's `SOUL.md` and `IDENTITY.md`. What is one personality trait you'd like to adjust or add to make David more efficient for your specific work?
- **Experiment:** Try asking David: "David, what tools do you have access to right now?" and see if his answer matches his Identity.

### [2026-02-19] Lesson 2: The Agentic Loop (Tools & Autonomy) - COMPLETED ✅
- **Concept:** Agents operate in a loop: **Thought -> Tool Call -> Result -> Observation**. Unlike a chatbot that just talks, an agent uses tools to change the state of the world (e.g., writing files, running backups).
- **Task:** Today, you saw me using `cron` and `exec` to fix the API Rate Limit. 
- **Task Quest:** Ask me to create a simple text file named `mastery_test.txt` in the workspace with your name inside. Then, ask me to delete it. Watch how I think through each step before I act.
- **Thought Exercise:** Why is it important for an agent to "Think" before using a tool? (Hint: Safety and Accuracy).
- **Nolan's Insight:** Like a human, an agent needs to plan and identify necessary resources (like a pencil and paper) before starting a task.

### [2026-02-20] Lesson 3: Memory Systems (Context vs. Persistence) - COMPLETED ✅
- **Concept:** An agent has two types of "brains": 
    1. **Short-term (Context):** What we are talking about right now. It is fast but gets full (API limits).
    2. **Long-term (Persistence):** Files like `MEMORY.md`. It stays even if the session is deleted.
- **Task:** Think of one important fact about your work or a preference you have. Ask me to "Remember this in my long-term memory."
- **Experiment:** After I confirm, ask me "David, what do you know about [that topic]?" and see how I use the `memory_search` tool to find it.
- **Thought Exercise:** How does having a "Long-term Memory" make an agent more like a real assistant?
- **Nolan's Insight:** Just like a human, if you teach them, they can learn and show progress, which makes them feel like a real assistant.
