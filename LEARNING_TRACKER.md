### [2026-02-18] Lesson 1: Understanding Agentic Identity
- **Concept:** What makes an 'Agent' different from a 'Chatbot'? (It's the SOUL/Identity and the ability to use tools).
- **Task:** Review David's `SOUL.md` and `IDENTITY.md`. What is one personality trait you'd like to adjust or add to make David more efficient for your specific work?
- **Experiment:** Try asking David: "David, what tools do you have access to right now?" and see if his answer matches his Identity.
